# G8OS Resource Pool

A G8OS resource pool is a **cluster of G8OS nodes** connected through a ZeroTier network.

All documentation is in the [`/docs`](./docs) directory, including a [table of contents](/docs/SUMMARY.md).

In [Getting Started with G8OS Resource Pool](/docs/gettingstarted/gettingstarted.md) you find the recommended path to quickly get up and running.
